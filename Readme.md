# 🛰️ Kuiper EGSE Deployment  
Mission-Critical Satellite Test Infrastructure • EGSE / ATE / KTE • Secure Automation

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents the engineering work behind deploying, maintaining, and supporting **Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE)** systems used for satellite testing and validation.  
The environment integrates **ATE**, **KTE**, **Linux/Windows hybrid systems**, and secure automation workflows to ensure reliable spacecraft testing operations.

This work reflects hands-on engineering in a **mission-critical aerospace environment**, where reliability, precision, and security are non‑negotiable.
