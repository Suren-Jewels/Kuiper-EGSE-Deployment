## 🧱 Core Architectural Components

### **EGSE Racks**
Linux-based Electrical Ground Support Equipment systems responsible for executing satellite test operations, hardware interfacing, and communication validation.

### **ATE Servers (Automated Test Equipment)**
Linux-based systems used to automate test execution, collect results, and interface with EGSE hardware during spacecraft validation cycles.

### **KTE Servers (Kuiper Test Environment)**
Windows-based systems supporting knowledge-driven test workflows, operator interfaces, and specialized Kuiper test tooling.

### **Networking Layer**
- DHCP, DNS, and segmented VLANs  
- Secure routing between EGSE, ATE, and KTE environments  
- Cisco ISR/ASR gateway for traffic control and firewall enforcement  
- VPN access for remote diagnostics and vendor collaboration  

### **Security Layer**
- IL4/IL5-aligned compliance controls  
- Endpoint protection (CrowdStrike)  
- Disk encryption (BitLocker)  
- MFA and RBAC enforcement across Linux and Windows systems

## 🔄 Architecture Flow (High-Level)
📡 Amazon Kuiper — EGSE Deployment Architecture

### Components
• EGSE racks
• Linux + Windows test nodes
• Configuration server
• Validation pipeline
• Deployment orchestration scripts
• Logging + monitoring stack

### Flow
1. Deployment scripts push baseline config → EGSE racks  
2. Validation pipeline runs readiness checks  
3. Test nodes register with orchestration layer  
4. Logs + metrics feed into monitoring dashboard  
5. Multi-phase deployment workflow repeats across 8 stages

## 🧩 Architectural Intent

The architecture is designed to ensure:

- Reliable and repeatable satellite test operations  
- Secure communication between multi-platform test environments  
- Controlled access for engineering, vendor, and test teams  
- High availability and rapid troubleshooting through monitoring and logging  
- Compliance with aerospace security and operational standards
