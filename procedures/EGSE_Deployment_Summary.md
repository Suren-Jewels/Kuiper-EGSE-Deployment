# EGSE Deployment Summary

This document outlines the high-level process used to deploy 5 EGSE satellite testing racks for Amazon’s Project Kuiper.

## 📦 Rack Preparation

- Verified hardware compatibility and firmware versions
- Coordinated with vendors for delivery and integration
- Performed initial diagnostics and power-on tests

## 🔧 Infrastructure Setup

- Provisioned and configured multi-platform test environments:

  - Linux-based EGSE (Electrical Ground Support Equipment) systems
  - Windows-based KTE (Kuiper Test Environment) servers
- Set up secure networking: DHCP, DNS, VPN, and TCP/IP routing
  - Configured secure gateway routing between EGSE, ATE, and KTE environments
  - Deployed Cisco-based gateway (ISR/ASR) for traffic control and firewall enforcement
  - Enabled VPN access for remote diagnostics and vendor collaboration
  - Integrated Cisco hardware and Ubuntu control systems
  - Applied IL4/IL5 compliance controls and endpoint protection (CrowdStrike, BitLocker)

## ⚙️ Automation & Onboarding

- Developed PowerShell scripts for engineer onboarding
- Created Python scripts for rack health checks and diagnostics
- Documented procedures in Confluence and Quip

## ✅ Validation & Handoff

- Achieved 100% operational readiness across all racks
- Delivered documentation and training to Kuiper engineering teams
- Completed deployment 15% ahead of schedule
